      <description>PCluster Manager is an open source project that leverages the AWS ParallelCluster API to create a web-based user interface for performing cluster management actions on your HPC clusters. This way you can create and manage your clusters through a web browser with point-and-click actions rather than through your terminal.
PCluster Manager is entirely serverless. Authentication is provided through Amazon Cognito, which is why a valid email is required as part of deploying the PCluster Manager stack.</description>
