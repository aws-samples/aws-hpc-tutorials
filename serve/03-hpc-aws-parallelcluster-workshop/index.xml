      <description>About AWS ParallelCluster AWS ParallelCluster is an open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. ParallelCluster uses a simple text file to model and provision all the resources needed for your HPC applications in an automated and secure manner. It also supports multiple instance types and job submission queues, and job schedulers like AWS Batch and Slurm.</description>

      <description>This lab requires an AWS Cloud9 IDE. If you do not have an AWS Cloud9 IDE set up, complete sections a. Sign in to the Console through d. Work with the AWS CLI in the Getting Started in the Cloud workshop.
  In the AWS Management Console search bar, type and select Cloud9. Choose open IDE for the Cloud9 instance set up previously. It may take a few moments for the IDE to open.</description>

      <description>Typically, to configure AWS ParallelCluster, you use the interactive command pcluster configure to provide the information, such as the AWS Region, VPC, Subnet, and Amazon EC2 Instance Type. For this workshop, you will create a custom configuration file to include the HPC specific options for this lab.
In this section, you will set up the foundation (for example network, scheduler, &amp;hellip;) required to build the ParallelCluster config file in the next section.</description>

      <title>d. Create a Cluster Config</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/04-configure-pc.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/04-configure-pc.html</guid>
      <description>Now that you installed AWS ParallelCluster and set up the foundation, you can create a configuration file to build a simple HPC Cluster. This file is generated in your home directory.
Generate the cluster with the following settings:
 Head-node and compute nodes: m5.2xlarge and c5n.18xlarge instances. You can change the instance type if you like, but you may run into EC2 limits that may prevent you from creating instances or create too many instances.</description>

      <title>e. Build an HPC Cluster</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/06-launch-pc.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/06-launch-pc.html</guid>
      <description>In this section, you create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster, you use the command pcluster create-cluster.
In your AWS Cloud9 terminal, run the following to create a cluster. Make sure that the configuration file path is correct.
pcluster create-cluster --region ${AWS_REGION} --cluster-name hpc-cluster-lab --cluster-configuration my-cluster-config.yaml The pcluster create-cluster command might output a few warnings, the cluster creation will progress.
TeamRole:~/environment $ source env_vars TeamRole:~/environment $ pcluster create-cluster --region ${AWS_REGION} --cluster-name hpc-cluster-lab --cluster-configuration my-cluster-config.</description>

      <title>f. About AWS PCluster Manager</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/07-pcluster-manager-intro.html</link>

      <description>PCluster Manager is an open source project that leverages the AWS ParallelCluster API to create a web-based user interface for performing cluster management actions on your HPC clusters. This way you can create and manage your clusters through a web browser with point-and-click actions rather than through your terminal.
PCluster Manager is entirely serverless. Authentication is provided through Amazon Cognito, which is why a valid email is required as part of deploying the PCluster Manager stack.</description>

      <description>If you are participating in this workshop as part of ISC22, then PCluster Manager will already be deployed for you. If not you will find below the steps to deploy it on your account.
 Once your PCluster Manager CloudFormation stack has been deployed, you can follow these steps to connect to it:
  Go to the AWS Console and use the search box to search for AWS CloudFormation.</description>

      <title>h. Connect to the Cluster</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/09-connect-cluster.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/09-connect-cluster.html</guid>
      <description>The cluster we created on the previous page takes about ~10 mins to create. While you&amp;rsquo;re waiting grab a ☕️.
Once the cluster goes into CREATE COMPLETE, we can connect to the head node in one of the following three ways, either through the shell, via the DCV, or via SSH:
SHELL is ideal for quick terminal access to the head node.
DCV is a full graphical remote desktop that allows you to run GUI applications on the head node.</description>

      <title>i. Get to know your Cluster</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/10-run-commands.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/10-run-commands.html</guid>
      <description>Now that you are connected to the head node, familiarize yourself with the cluster structure by running the following set of commands.
SLURM SLURM from SchedMD is one of the batch schedulers that you can use in AWS ParallelCluster. For an overview of the SLURM commands, see the SLURM Quick Start User Guide.
  List existing partitions and nodes per partition. You should see two nodes if your run this command after creating your cluster, and zero nodes if running it 10 minutes after creation (default cooldown period for AWS ParallelCluster, you don&amp;rsquo;t pay for what you don&amp;rsquo;t use).</description>

      <title>l. CONUS 12-km Model</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/11-conus-12km.html</link>

      <description>The steps here can also be executed on any cluster running SLURM. There may be some variations depending on your configuration.
 In this step, you run the WRF CONUS 12km test case job to introduce you to the mechanisms of AWS ParallelCluster.
Preparatory Steps Make sure that you are logged into the AWS ParallelCluster head node through the AWS Cloud9 terminal.
 Download CONUS 12KM Input data used for simulating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are 12-km CONUS input.</description>

      <description>Submit your First Job Submitted jobs are immediately processed if the job is in the queue and a sufficient number of compute nodes exist.
If there are not enough compute nodes to satisfy the computational requirements of the job, such as the number of cores, AWS ParallelCluster creates new instances to satisfy the requirements of the jobs sitting in the queue. However, note that you determined the minimum and maximum number of nodes when you created the cluster.</description>

      <description>In this next section, we&amp;rsquo;re going to visualize the results of the job we just ran using NCL. NCL will be pre-installed on your Cluster.
  Connect to the Head node via DCV, following instructions from part f. Connect to the Cluster
  In a terminal navigate to the WRF run directory.
  cd /shared/conus_12km The provided ncl_scripts/surface.ncl script will generate two plots of surface fields at valid time 2019-11-27 00:00.</description>
