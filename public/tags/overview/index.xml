      <description>In this lab, you are introduced to AWS ParallelCluster and will run a Weather forecast model (WRF) on the HPC Cluster on AWS. This workshop includes the following steps:
 Install and configure ParallelCluster on your AWS Cloud9 IDE. Create your first cluster. Submit a sample job and check what is happening in the background. Delete the cluster.  About Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications.</description>
