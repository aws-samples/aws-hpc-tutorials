      <description>This lab requires an AWS Cloud9 IDE. If you do not have an AWS Cloud9 IDE set up, complete sections a. Sign in to the Console through d. Work with the AWS CLI in the Getting Started in the Cloud workshop.
  In the AWS Management Console search bar, type and select Cloud9. Choose open IDE for the Cloud9 instance set up previously. It may take a few moments for the IDE to open.</description>

      <title>b. Set up AWS ParallelCluster foundation</title>

      <description>Typically, to configure AWS ParallelCluster, you use the interactive command pcluster configure to provide the information, such as the AWS Region, VPC, Subnet, and Amazon EC2 Instance Type. For this workshop, you will create a custom configuration file to include the HPC specific options for this lab.
In this section, you will set up the foundation (for example network, scheduler, &amp;hellip;) required to build the ParallelCluster config file in the next section.</description>

      <title>c. Create a Cluster Config</title>

      <description>Now that you installed AWS ParallelCluster and set up the foundation, you can create a configuration file to build a simple HPC system. This file is generated in your home directory.
Generate the cluster with the following settings:
 Head-node and compute nodes: c5.xlarge instances. You can change the instance type if you like, but you may run into EC2 limits that may prevent you from creating instances or create too many instances.</description>

      <title>d. Build an HPC Cluster</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/06-launch-pc.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/06-launch-pc.html</guid>
      <description>In this section, you create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster, you use the command pcluster create and the &amp;amp;ndash;config (or -c) option to use another configuration file other than the default one.
If you create your cluster without using the &amp;ndash;config (or -c) option, then AWS ParallelCluster uses the default configuration with the minimum requirements to get a cluster running. For example, the default configuration for head and compute nodes is t2.</description>

      <title>e. Log in to Your Cluster</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/07-logon-pc.html</link>

      <description>The pcluster ssh is a wrapper around SSH. Depending on the case, you can also log in to your head node using ssh and the public or private IP address.
 You can list existing clusters using the following command. This is a convenient way to find the name of a cluster in case you forget it.
pcluster list --color -r $AWS_REGION Now that your cluster has been created, log in to the head node using the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal:</description>

      <title>f. Submit a tightly coupled HPC job</title>
      <link>https://www.hpcworkshops.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/08-run-1stjob.html</link>

      <description>The steps here can also be executed on any cluster running SLURM. There may be some variations depending on your configuration.
 In this step, you run the WRF CONUS 12km test case job to introduce you to the mechanisms of AWS ParallelCluster.
Preparatory Steps Make sure that you are logged into the AWS ParallelCluster head node through the AWS Cloud9 terminal.
 Download CONUS 12KM Input data used for simulating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are 12-km CONUS input.</description>

      <description>Congratulations, you have deployed a HPC Cluster on AWS !
In this lab, you have:
 Configured your HPC Cluster Deployed a HPC Cluster in the cloud. Run a tighly couple application: WRF on the CONUS 12KM test case.  In the next lab, you will learn how to build a Docker container image and how to run a container on the HPC cluster in the cloud.
You can learn more about AWS ParallelCluster by visiting the documentation.</description>
