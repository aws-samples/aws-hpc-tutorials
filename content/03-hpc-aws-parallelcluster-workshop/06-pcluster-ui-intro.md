[AWS ParallelCluster UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/pcui-using-v3.html) is a web UI built for AWS ParallelCluster that makes it easy to create, update, and access HPC clusters. It gives you a quick way to connect to clusters via shell [SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-session-manager/) or remote desktop [NICE DCV](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/). The UI is built using the [AWS ParallelCluster API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/api-reference-v3.html), making it fully compatible with any cluster 3.X or greater regardless of if you create the cluster through the API, CLI or Web UI.

Authentication for ParallelCluster UI is provided through Amazon Cognito, which is why a valid email is required as part of deploying the PCluster Manager stack. Attendees at ISC23 will provide an initial login in the following steps.

### Benefits
#### Creation of Clusters

Step-by-Step guidance is given for creating (and modifying) a cluster. A dry-run validation of the cluster configuration before deployment allows for checks before resources are used. The underlying text-based provisioning methods are still used, allowing for repeatability of deployment.

#### Monitoring and Managing Clusters

In one web-based interface, it is possible to display:
- The list of clusters you've created in your AWS account with AWS ParallelCluster.
- The available status and details for your listed clusters.
- CloudFormation stack event and AWS ParallelCluster logs that you can use for monitoring.
- The status of jobs that are running on your clusters.
- The list of custom images that you can use to build clusters.
- The list of official images that the UI uses to create clusters.
- The list of users that have access to the AWS ParallelCluster UI. You can add and remove users.

#### Seamless Migration to the Cloud
AWS ParallelCluster supports a wide variety of operating systems and batch schedulers so you can migrate your existing HPC workloads with little to no modifications.

### AWS ParallelCluster UI Architecture

AWS ParallelCluster UI is built on a fully serverless architecture, in most cases itâ€™s completely free to run, you just pay for the clusters themselves.

### Deployment

ParallelCluster UI is deployed as a CloudFormation Stack. As it requires about 20 minutes to deploy, your workshop account already has it deployed.

If you wish to use these instructions outside the workshop, please choose the appropriate region you with to use from the [ParallelCluster UI docs page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install-pcui-v3.html) to deploy ParallelCluster UI, and follow the install instructions there.

In the next step you will connect to your running ParallelCluster UI.
