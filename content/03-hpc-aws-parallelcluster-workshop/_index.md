[AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) is an AWS-supported open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. ParallelCluster uses a simple text file to model and provision all the resources needed for your HPC applications in an automated and secure manner. It also supports a variety of job schedulers such as AWS Batch, SGE, Torque, and Slurm for easy job submissions.

AWS ParallelCluster is built on the popular open source CfnCluster project and is released via the Python Package Index (PyPI). ParallelCluster's source code is hosted on the Amazon Web Services repository on GitHub. AWS ParallelCluster is available at no additional charge, and you pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.

### Benefits
#### Automatic Resource Scaling

With AWS ParallelCluster, you can use a simple text file to model, provision, and dynamically scale the resources needed for your applications in an automated and secure manner.

#### Easy Cluster Management
With AWS ParallelCluster you can provision resources in a safe, repeatable manner, allowing you to build and rebuild your infrastructure without the need for manual actions or custom scripts.

#### Seamless Migration to the Cloud
AWS ParallelCluster supports a wide variety of operating systems and batch schedulers so you can migrate your existing HPC workloads with little to no modifications.

### How It Works

{{% notice info %}}This lab requires an AWS Cloud9 IDE. If you do not have an AWS Cloud9 IDE set up, complete sections *a. Sign in to the Console* through *d. Work with the AWS CLI* in the [**Getting Started in the Cloud**](/02-aws-getting-started.html) workshop.

In this lab, you are introduced to [AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) and how to run your HPC jobs in AWS as you would on-premises. This workshop includes the following steps:

- Install and configure ParallelCluster on your AWS Cloud9 IDE.
- Create your first cluster.
- Submit a sample job and check what is happening in the background.
- Delete the cluster.
