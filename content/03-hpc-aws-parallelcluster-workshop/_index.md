In this lab, we will introduce you to [AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) using PCluster Manager. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Connect to PCluster Manager.
- Create your HPC cluster in AWS.
- Connect to your new cluster via the PCluster Manager console.
- Submit a sample job and check what is happening in the background.

To get started, we'll review what AWS ParallelCluster is and dive into the AWS ParallelCluster API.
