[AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) is an AWS supported open source cluster management tool that helps you to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS Cloud. Built on the open source CfnCluster project, AWS ParallelCluster enables you to quickly build an HPC compute environment in AWS. It automatically sets up the required compute resources, Slurm Scheduler and shared file system. AWS ParallelCluster facilitates quick start proof of concept deployments and production deployments. You can also build higher level workflows, such as a genomics portal that automates an entire DNA sequencing workflow, on top of AWS ParallelCluster.

{{% notice info %}}This lab requires an AWS Cloud9 IDE. If you do not have an AWS Cloud9 IDE set up, complete sections *a. Sign in to the Console* through *d. Work with the AWS CLI* in the [**Getting Started in the Cloud**](/02-aws-getting-started.html) workshop.

In this lab, you are introduced to [AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) and how to run your HPC jobs in AWS as you would on-premises. This workshop includes the following steps:

- Install and configure ParallelCluster on your AWS Cloud9 IDE.
- Create your first cluster.
- Submit a sample job and check what is happening in the background.
- Delete the cluster.
