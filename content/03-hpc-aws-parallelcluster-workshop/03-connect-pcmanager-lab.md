Once your PCluster Manager CloudFormation stack has been deployed, you can follow these steps to connect to it:

- Go to the AWS Console and use the search box to search for [**AWS CloudFormation**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home). 

- Once **CloudFormation** appears in your search results, click on it to open the CloudFormation Management Console.

- You'll see a stack named **mod-[random hash]**. Click on that stack, then click on the **Outputs** tab, and finally click on the **PclusterManagerUrl** to connect to PCluster Manager.
