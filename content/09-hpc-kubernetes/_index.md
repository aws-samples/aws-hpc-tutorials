This lab requires a Kubernetes cluster. If you are working on this lab as part of an AWS presented event, a cluster is already provisioned in your lab environment. If you do not have a cluster available, you can use the **[provision-eks-cluster](06-provision-eks-cluster)** instructions to provision a new cluster.

In this lab, you are introduced to deploy and use a container orchestrator such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for running HPC applications. You will run a high-performance application for molecular dynamics, [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/), that reads and writes data from/to a managed Lustre parallel file system, Amazon FSx for Lustre.

The deployment of Kubernetes is a challenging endeavour when done on your own. In the cloud, managed service simplifies the installation, operation and maintenance of Kubernetes. [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed Kubernetes service on AWS.

### About Amazon EKS
Amazon EKS is is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. In the cloud, Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services. On-premises, EKS provides a consistent, fully-supported Kubernetes solution with integrated tooling and simple deployment to AWS Outposts, virtual machines, or bare metal servers.


As part of this lab, you will deploy the below architecture to run GROMACS:

Lab workflow:

- Provision Amazon EKS cluster
- Provision FSx for Lustre volume
- Setup monitoring
- Deploy Kubeflow MPI Operator
- Run EFA latency ping-pong test
- Run GROMACS MPI job
- Delete FSx volume and the EKS cluster
