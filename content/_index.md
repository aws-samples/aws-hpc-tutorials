# Welcome to the Amazon Web Services HPC Workshops

Amazon Web Services provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your [HPC applications](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/). With AWS' virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, and HPC system owners can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

AWS delivers an integrated suite of services that provides everything you need to quickly and easily build and manage HPC clusters in the cloud. With this elastic infrastructure you can run even your most compute-intensive workloads regardless of your industry and application.

Workloads running on AWS with the tools detailed in this workshop span both traditional HPC applications--genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, computer aided engineering, weather prediction, and seismic imaging--as well as emerging applications, such as machine learning, deep learning, and autonomous driving.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity that can come from using fixed, on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible configuration and virtually unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services like Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), you can redefine traditional HPC workflows to innovate faster.

Today, more HPC is run on AWS than on any other cloud.
