Thank you for attending this workshop. During your time with us you learned how to manage HPC clusters with PCluster Manager and the AWS API. As you have seen, the AWS ParallelCluster API enables you to drive the lifecycle of your HPC clusters with a Python Client. This provides you the ability to operate these clusters through code and automate their management, for example using [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).

Feel free to run this workshop on your own and visit the links below:

- [Deploy PCluster Manager](/05-after-event/04-pcluster-stacks.html): learn how to deploy the PCluster Manager stack on your own AWS account.
- [Connect to PCluster Manager](/05-after-event/05-connect-pcmanager.html):  locate the PCluster manager web based user interface.
