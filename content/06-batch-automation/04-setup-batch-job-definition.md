In this step, you set up a template used for your jobs, known as a job definition. A job definition is not required, but a good practice to use so that you can version how your jobs are launched. For more information about job definitions, see [Job Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_definitions.html).


Run the following commands on your Cloud9 terminal

1. Copy the Cloudformation template which will be used to create the AWS Batch Job Definition.

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://isc22-hpc-labs/isc22-nextflow-batch-jd.template.yaml .
```

2. Set the following environment variables to be passed as parameters to the Cloudformation stack. 
	- **ImageId** - The name of the Amazon ECR container repository where the Docker image is stored. You will run the image that you built in Lab III. 
	- **ECSRoleArn** - The name of the ECS task execution role created in Section b. of this Lab.
	- **BucketNameResults** - The name of the Amazon S3 bucket created in Section a. of this Lab to store the results of the Nextflow pipeline run. 
	- **NFJobQueue** - The name of the AWS Batch job-queue to execute the downstream Nextflow jobs.

```bash
REPOSITORY_NAME=isc22-container
ImageId=`aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names ${REPOSITORY_NAME} --output text --query 'repositories[0].[repositoryUri]' --region $AWS_REGION`
echo "export ImageId=${ImageId}"

ECSRoleName=ecsTaskExecutionRole
ECSRoleArn=`aws iam get-role --role-name ${ECSRoleName} --query 'Role.[Arn]' --output text`
echo "export ECSRoleArn=${ECSRoleArn}"

NFJobQueue=nextflow-jq
echo "export NFJobQueue=${NFJobQueue}"

source s3_vars
BucketNameResults=${BUCKET_NAME_RESULTS}
echo "export BucketNameResults=${BucketNameResults}"
``` 

3. Deploy the Cloudformation template to create the Batch Job definition.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name nextflow-batch-jd --template-file isc22-nextflow-batch-jd.template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region ${AWS_REGION} --parameter-overrides  NFJobQueue=${NFJobQueue} BucketNameResults=${BucketNameResults} ImageId=${ImageId} ECSRoleArn=${ECSRoleArn}
```

4. It will take a few mins for the stack to be created. Once complete you will see a message as below: 
```bash
Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
Successfully created/updated stack - nextflow-batch-jd
```
 
5. Verify that the Batch resources are created successfully. In the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **Batch** 

6. In the left pane, choose **Job definitions** and confirm that a Job Definition **nextflow-demo** is created. Make sure *Status* is **ACTIVE**.

At this point, you have completed creating the Batch environment. Next, take a closer look at **compute environment**, **job queue**, and **job definition** you created.

Highly recommended to examine the contents of the downloaded Cloudformation template (**isc22-nextflow-batch-ce-jq.template.yaml**) to understand the usage of infrastructure as code to create the Batch resources in this section.
