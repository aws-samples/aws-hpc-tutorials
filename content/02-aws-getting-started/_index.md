This workshop will walk you through setting up infrastructure to run your own HPC workloads. You will learn how to navigate the AWS Management Console, access relevant services, and how to deploy a basic infrastructure.

Specifically, you will learn how to sign in to and explore the AWS Management Console. Once you are familiar with the AWS Management Console, you can move on to the next stage of the workshop.

<!-- Total cost to run this lab is expected to be less than **two dollars should you run it on your own or company account** if the guide is followed as discussed, in one sitting, and including the deletion of all resources outlined through the guide. -->
