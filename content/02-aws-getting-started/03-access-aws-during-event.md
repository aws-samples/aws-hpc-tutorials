Temporary lab accounts are only available on May 21st 2023 for the duration of the tutorial. To continue using AWS after the event, [create an AWS Account](<https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/>). If you would like to run through the labs at a later stage on your own, with your company or institution, please contact us at isctutorial@amazon.com so we can follow-up with you.
