1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, type **EC2**.
2. Choose **EC2** to open the **EC2 Dashboard**.

Although instances are generally launched through scripts, they can also be launched directly from the EC2 Dashboard.

Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the layout of the dashboard:

- Left pane: Tools and features, such as the saved Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), storage volumes, and ssh keys (Key Pairs).
- Center: Resource listings and the ability to launch an instance.
- Right pane: General information, such as documentation and pricing.
