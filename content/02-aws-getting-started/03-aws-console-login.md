To access your lab account you will need to use [**Event Engine**](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/) with the credentials provided during the tutorial as described in the [**SC20 Tutorial Resources**](01-hpc-overview/03-access-aws.html)

After signing in, take a few minutes to explore the navigation components of the AWS Management Console.

- A search bar allows you to quickly locate services based on text.
- Recently visited services are located below the search bar.
- In the toolbar, the Services drop-down menu populates a list of all services.
- The Support drop-down menu includes links to support and [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com).
- The Region drop-down menu allows you to select a specific AWS Region.

Start this workshop by selecting an **AWS Region**:

Choose the **Region** drop-down menu, then choose **US East (N. Virginia)** us-east-1.
