After you sign in, take a few minutes to explore the navigation components of the AWS Management Console.

- Recently visited services are located below the search bar. 
- In the toolbar, the Services drop-down menu populates a list of all services.
- The Support drop-down menu includes links to support and [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com).
