This workshop walks you through setting up your own Weather Forecasting environment. You learn how to navigate the AWS Management Console, access relevant services, and how to deploy a basic infrastructure.
Specifically, you learn how to:

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.
- Deploy the AWS ParallelCluster API and the Pcluster Manager stacks.

You can proceed to the next stage of the workshop once the preparation completed and the stacks deployed.
