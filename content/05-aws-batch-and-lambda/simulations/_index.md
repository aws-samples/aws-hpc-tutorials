The open-source software package [Quantlib](https://www.quantlib.org/) is chosen to value American Options with Monte Carlo simulations. The system can be used to run other Linux-compatible binaries or scripts as well by updating the "program" variable in the bootstrap file and replacing the application "EquityOption" in Dockerfile.
