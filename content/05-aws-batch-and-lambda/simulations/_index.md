The open-source software package [Quantlib](https://www.quantlib.org/) is chosen to value American Options with Monte-Carlo simulations. The system can be used to run other Linux-compatible binaries or scripts as well by updating the "Application" directory and the "program" variable in the bootstrap file. The default program variable value "EquityOption" can be overwritten by the environment variable of Batch or Lambda as well.
