Cloud computing gains its popularity as a result of growing demand on compute power and the benefit of improving productivity with overall cost reductions. The workshop provides step-by-step instructions to build a distributed system with a cloud-native event-event driven architecture. AWS Lambada is for jobs requiring fast turnaround and Batch is chosen to scale beyond thousands of CPUs efficiently and cost-effectively. You will calculate American option price with Monte Carlo simulations using the QuantLib open-source software library to illustrate workloads requiring intensive compute resources can be done timely with the system.
