HPC Applications typically rely on several libraries and software components along with complex dependencies.
Those applications tend to be deployed on a shared file system for on-premise HPC systems.
It can be challenging to share and deploy the same applications across different HPC systems.
In the cloud, there are various ways to deploy an application: on a shared file system or an [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).
Shared file systems in the cloud tend to last for a short period of time, typically the length of job.
A machine image is a basic unit of deployment for Amazon EC2 instances and is another mechanism to deploy your application across many Amazon EC2 instances.
However, when the application is modified with bug fixes or updated with new features, you will need to create a new EC2 instance using the new machine image.

Containers have simplified the way groups develop, share and run software.
The growth of container technology has been mainly led by Docker which provides a way to package an application and its dependencies into a container image that can be run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises or in the cloud.
In HPC, the use of containers mainly started in Life Science to help address the growing number of software dependencies that computational bioinformatic applications have.
Many container runtimes have been created for HPC use-cases, e.g., [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/), [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/), [Shifter](https://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/user-defined-images/), [CharlieCloud](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) and [Sarus](https://sarus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). These runtimes allow end-users to run containers in environments where Docker would not be feasible (due to security concerns with the shared filesystems and multi-user execution environments that are common in classic HPC cluster environments) and include various optimisations and/or conveniences relevant for HPC (such as accelerator plugins, fabrics/MPI support, custom image formats).
In addition, containers enable easy sharing of applications (the consumer does not need to build the application themselves for their specific platform so long as they have a compatible container runtime) and deployment of new versions on existing servers (such as EC2 instances) without changing the machine image.


In this lab, you will create a container using Docker and use Singularity to run the container on the AWS HPC cluster that you created in Lab I.
This lab includes the following steps:

- Modify your HPC cluster configuration file for AWS ParallelCluster.
- Update your HPC cluster to install Docker, Singularity and provide access to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
- Create your containerized application.
- Submit a sample job to run your containerized workload.
