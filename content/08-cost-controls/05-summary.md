Congratulations, you have completed the AWS ParallelCluster cost control lab!

In this lab, you have:
- Configured Slurm Accounting Resource Limits in an HPC cluster.
- Converted a dollar budget to CPU minutes and applied that as a limit to the cluster.
- Published a custom CloudWatch metric for cluster cost and visualized the data in the Amazon CloudWatch ParallelCluster Dashboard.

You can learn more about Slurm Accounting in AWS ParallelCluster by visiting the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/slurm-accounting-v3.html).
