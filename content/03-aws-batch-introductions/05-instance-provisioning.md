In the previous step, we have seen how instances are requested by AWS Batch, but not how they are provisioned. In this step, you will explore instance provisioning and allocation strategies.

#### Instance Provisioning
Instance provisioning is handled by Amazon EC2, it picks instances based on the list generated by AWS Batch and the Allocation Strategy selected when configuring your Compute Environment. 


#### Allocation Strategies
With the Allocation Strategy: 
- **`BEST_FIT` (BF)** - Amazon EC2 picks the least expensive instance
- **`BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` (BFP)** - Amazon EC2 picks the least expensive instances and picks additional instance types if the previously selected types are not available.
- **`SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` (SCO)** - Amazon EC2 Spot selects instances that are less likely to see interruptions.

Instance provisioning is directed by one or more Auto-Scaling groups or a Spot Fleet depending on the purchasing model selected. If using `BEST_FIT` and the Spot purchasing model, AWS Batch uses a Spot Fleet which can contain differing instance types. If using `BEST_FIT` and the On-Demand purchasing model, one ASG is used per instance type. For `BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE` and `SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`, a single ASG is used to provision all the instances for a Compute Environment regardless of the purchasing model. From a performance or behavior perspective, thereâ€™s no major difference between these approaches.

#### To explore the compute environment
1. Open the **AWS Batch** console to see the AWS Batch Dashboards ([link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/))
2. Observe the provisioning model and instance types chosen for the Compute environment. 
3. Choose the **compute environment**.

4. Review the details about the compute environment built by the Batch CloudFormation stack. ![job submission](/images/aws-batch/deep-dive/AWS_Batch___Compute_environments___Details___ComputeEnvironment1-lxGus0AlMOsVNSaw.png) 

#### Next Steps:
Now that you understand the AWS Batch job lifecycle and how instances ar provisioned, in the next section we will talk a bit about optimization of your AWS Batch workload.
