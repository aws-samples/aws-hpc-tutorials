**Optionally**, you can also create a cluster configuration file in AWS ParallelCluster using the command-line: `pcluster configure --config config.yaml`, in your cloud9 shell and walk through the configure menu. This step generates a config file which you can modify further as needed.

```yaml
$ pcluster configure --config config.yaml
INFO: Configuration file test will be written.

Beginning VPC creation. Please do not leave the terminal until the creation is finalized
Creating CloudFormation stack...
Do not leave the terminal until the process has finished.

Stack Name: parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20211116161450 (id: arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:008xxxxxx:stack/parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20211116161450/680fea70-46f8-11ec-b10b-022a17eafb09)
Status: parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20211116161450 - CREATE_COMPLETE      

The stack has been created.
Configuration file written to config.yaml
You can edit your configuration file or simply run 'pcluster create-cluster --cluster-configuration config.yaml --cluster-name cluster-name --region eu-west-1' to create your cluster.
```

Now, you can check the contents of this configuration file:

```yaml
$ cat config.yaml

Region: eu-west-1
Image:
  Os: alinux2
HeadNode:
  InstanceType: c5.xlarge
  Networking:
    SubnetId: subnet-xxxxxxxxxxx
  Ssh:
    KeyName: lab-your-key
Scheduling:
  Scheduler: slurm
  SlurmQueues:
  - Name: compute
    ComputeResources:
    - Name: c5xlarge
      InstanceType: c5.xlarge
      MinCount: 0
      MaxCount: 8
    Networking:
      SubnetIds:
      - subnet-yyyyyyyyyy
```

This configuration file allows you to create a simple cluster with the minimum required information. A default configuration file is good to have for testing purposes.

Next, you build a configuration to generate an optimized cluster to run typical "tightly coupled" HPC applications.
