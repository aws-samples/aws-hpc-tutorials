[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. This workshop uses Cloud9 to introduce you to the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) without the need to install any software on your laptop.

AWS Cloud9 contains a collection of tools that let you code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud using your internet browser. The IDE offers support for python, pip, AWS CLI, and provides easy access to AWS resources through Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials. The IDE includes a terminal with sudo privileges to the managed instance that is hosting your development environment and a pre-authenticated CLI. This makes it easy for you to quickly run commands and directly access AWS services.
