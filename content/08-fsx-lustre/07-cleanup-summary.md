In this lab you have learned how to create an FSx for lustre file system, an S3 bucket as well as creating Data Repository Action between FSx for lustre and S3. You have also leaned how to mount FSx for lustre on an EC2 instance and run HSM tests to realize automatic imports and exports of data to and from S3.
