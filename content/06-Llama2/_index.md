[Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/) is an open-source model from Meta AI, it's available in three variants 7B, 13B and 70B. In this section we'll install the model using a provided docker container, fetch the weights from Hugging Face, and run a sample *finetuning* task on 16 GPU's.
