In this section of the lab we'll setup the [Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS)](https://mpas-dev.github.io/). The MPAS model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. It is developed and maintained by by [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/weather-research-and-forecasting-model-MPAS).

It's easy to install with the package manager Spack. If you have not installed
Spack, please follow the [installing Spack](/02-cluster/04-install-spack.html)
section.

To do so we've broken it down into the following steps:

1. Install MPAS with Spack
2. Download supercell test case
3. Run the test case
