In this section, you will create and setup a build project in [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/).

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. 

With CodeBuild, you donâ€™t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers



1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, type and select **CodeBuild**. Double check that you are using CodeBuild in the same AWS Region that you have used in the previous steps.

2. Click on **Create build project**.

3. In the **Project configuration** section, enter **MyDemoBuild** as the **Project name** and leave the rest as defaults in this section.

5. In the **Source** section, select **AWS CodeCommit** from the dropdown as the **Source provider**. In the **Repository**, enter the name of the codecommit repository **MyDemoRepo** created earlier. For the **Branch** select the **main** branch (which contains the code, in this case the Docker container to build)

6. In the **Environment** section, select the settings as shown below
	- Make sure to enable the **Privileged** flag required to build the Docker images
	- Select the **New service role** and let the project create a new service role required for CodeBuild

7. Expand the **Additional configuration** section and, in the **Environment** section, keep all settings as default except the following:
  	- Under the **Environment variables**, in the **Name** field enter the Name as **REPOSITORY_URI** 
	- In the **Value** field provide the Amazon ECR repository URI created the last step (see below). Keep the Type as default **Plaintext**
	- You can obtain the Amazon ECR repository URI by running the below CLI command on Cloud9, this repo comes from Lab 2.
	- The output should look as **"\<account-id\>.dkr.ecr.\<region\>.amazonaws.com/sc22-container"**. Copy without the quotes and paste in the **Value** field.
 
```bash
export IMAGE_URI=$(aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-name sc22-container --query "repositories[0].repositoryUri" --output text)                                                                                                                                                
echo $IMAGE_URI
```

7. In the **Buildspec** section, select **Use a buildspec file** option. By default CodeBuild looks for a file named buildspec.yml in the source code root directory.  We will create a **buildspec.yml** file in a later step.
 
8. Keep the defaults in **Batch configuration** and **Artifacts** section.

9. In the **Logs** section enable the **CloudWatch logs**. This option will upload the build output logs to [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

10. Click on **Create build project**

11. Since the CodeBuild is going to interact with Amazon ECR, the CodeBuild service role created requires additional permissions. In the **Cloud9** terminal, execute the following 

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess --role-name codebuild-MyDemoBuild-service-role
```

When executing the above if you run into an error as shown below, it means you have not disabled AWS managed temporary credentials in Cloud9 as covered in the [Preparation](/02-aws-getting-started.html) section of the Lab. 
Kindly fix that and re-do the above step.

12. Create a buildspec file to build and push the Docker container to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

A [buildspec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) is a collection of build commands and related settings in YAML format. This file is used by [AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html) to automatically create an updated version of the container upon code changes. The buildspec file informs CodeBuild of all the actions that should be taken during a build run for your application. In the next section, you will dive deeper on what is CodeBuild and how to set it up as part of a pipeline. 
```bash

cat > buildspec.yml << EOF
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - aws --version
      - \$(aws ecr get-login --region \$AWS_REGION --no-include-email)
      - IMAGE_TAG=\$(echo \$CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-8)
      - echo IMAGE TAG \$IMAGE_TAG

  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started at \$(date)
      - echo Building the Docker image...
      - docker build -t \$REPOSITORY_URI:latest .
      - docker tag \$REPOSITORY_URI:latest \$REPOSITORY_URI:\$IMAGE_TAG

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed at $(date)
      - echo Pushing the Docker images...
      - docker push \$REPOSITORY_URI:latest
      - docker push \$REPOSITORY_URI:\$IMAGE_TAG

EOF
```

13. Commit the buildspec file and push to the CodeCommit repository.

```
git add buildspec.yml
git commit -m "add build specification file"
git push
```

In the next section, you will build a CodePipeline which you will use to automate your container build process
