Congratulations! You built a CI/CD pipeline uisng CodePipeline. 

Your pipeline began with code in CodeCommit, built a Docker container and pushed the image to Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using CodeBuild.

In the next lab, you will learn about container orchestration and how to deploy your container using AWS Batch.
