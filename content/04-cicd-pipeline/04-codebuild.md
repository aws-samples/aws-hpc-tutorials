In this section, you will create and setup a build project in [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/).

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. 

With CodeBuild, you donâ€™t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers

1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, type and select **CodeBuild**.

2. Click on **Create project**. This will open a **Create build project** section

3. In the **Project configuration** section, enter **MyDemoBuild** as the **Project name**

5. In the **Source** section, select **AWS CodeCommit** from the dropdown as the **Source provider**. In the **Repository**, enter the name of the codecommit repository **MyDemoRepo** created earlier. For the **Branch** select the **main** branch (which contains the code, in this case the Docker container to build)

6. In the **Environment** section, select the settings as shown below
	- Make sure to enable the **Privileged** flag required to build the Docker images
	- Select the **New service role** and let the project create a new service role required for CodeBuild

7. In the **Environment** section, expand the **Additional configuration** section 
  	- Under the **Environment variables** enter the Name **REPOSITORY_URI** which should point to the Amazon ECR repository created in the Lab 3.
	- In the **Value** provide the Amazon ECR repository URI. Keep the Type as default **Plaintext**
	- You can obtain the Amazon ECR repository URI by running the below CLI command on Cloud9, this repo comes from [Lab 2]
 
```bash
REPO_NAME=sc21-container
aws ecr describe-repositories --query repositories[].[repositoryName,repositoryUri] | grep "/${REPO_NAME}"
 ```

7. In the **Buildspec** section, select **Use a buildspec file** option. By default CodeBuild looks for a file named buildspec.yml in the source code root directory. Since we named our buildspec file as **buildspec.yml** and put it in the root directory of the CodeCommit repo, you can skip providing a name or absolute path
 
8. Keep the defaults in **Batch configuration** and **Artifacts** section. 

9. In the **Logs** section enable the **CloudWatch logs**. This option will upload the build output logs to [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

10. Click on **Create build project**

11. Since the CodeBuild is going to interact with Amazon ECR, the CodeBuild service role created requires additional permissions. In the **Cloud9** terminal, execute the following 

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess --role-name codebuild-MyDemoBuild-service-role
```


In the next section, you will build a CodePipeline which you will use to automate your container build process
