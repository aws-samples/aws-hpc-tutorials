In this step, you will prepare the environment on your own AWS account or a temporary AWS Account to run the various workshops.
Specifically, you will:

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.
- Create AWS Cloud9 environment, a cloud based IDE.
- Upgrade AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
- Resize the AWS Cloud9 root volume to build Docker container images.
- Look at AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance.
