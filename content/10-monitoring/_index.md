Performance monitoring and analysis are critical to deciphering the often complex behavior of HPC environments and applications. They help identify regions of code that are most frequently executed, thus allowing fine-tuning of application behavior for optimal runtime speed and resource usage. Elimination of various inefficiencies either introduced by the programmer or arising due to less than perfect mapping to a specific execution environment is vital to achieving acceptable application execution rates on a HPC cluster and increasing the users productivity.

This lab gives an overview of different methods and tools helpful in assessing application and infrastructure performance of your HPC cluster in the cloud.  

The lab is divided in two sections.

- In the first section, you will monitor your HPC Cluster with Prometheus, Node exporter and Grafana using AWS ParallelCluster. 
- In the second section, you will setup a simple job notification service using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

Architecture Overview:
![Monitoring Architecture](/images/monitoring/monitoring-arch.png)

Solution Components:

This lab is build with the following components:

[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics as well as create, explore, and share dashboards fostering a data driven culture.

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/) is an open-source project for systems and service monitoring from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/). It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

[Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/) is on open-source tool that allows ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus.

[Nginx](http://nginx.org/) is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

[Prometheus-Slurm-Exporter](https://github.com/vpenso/prometheus-slurm-exporter/) is a Prometheus collector and exporter for metrics extracted from the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) resource scheduling system.

[Node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by Linux kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

This workshop includes the following steps:

- Monitor your HPC Cluster with Prometheus, Node exporter and Grafana using AWS ParallelCluster
  - Create a HPC Cluster with monitoring and sample dashboards setup using AWS ParallelCluster
  - Review the different dashboards
  - Monitor the dashboards with application run
- SNS 
  - Update the IAM Role and attach a Policy to give SNS access to the cluster AmazonSNSFullAccess
  - Create the topic using the create-topic command as follows.
  - Subscribe your email address to the topic using the subscribe command
  - From your email application, open the message from AWS Notifications and confirm your subscription
  - Publish a test message to the topic using the publish command from a Slurm Job
  - Check your email to confirm that you received the message.
- Delete the cluster.


{{% notice info %}}This lab requires an AWS Cloud9 IDE. If you do not have an AWS Cloud9 IDE set up, complete sections *a. Sign in to the Console* through *d. Work with the AWS CLI* in the [**Getting Started in the Cloud**](/02-aws-getting-started.html) workshop.
