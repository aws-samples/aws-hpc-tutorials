In this section, you create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster, you use the command [**pcluster create**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/pluster.create.html) and the [**--config**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/pluster.create.html#pluster.create.namedarg) (or **-c**) option to use another configuration file other than the default one.

{{% notice tip %}}
If you create your cluster without using the**--config** (or **-c**) option, then AWS ParallelCluster uses the default configuration with the minimum requirements to get a cluster running. For example, the default configuration for head and compute nodes is *t2.micro* instances instead of *c5.xlarge*.

In your AWS Cloud9 terminal, run the following to create a cluster. Make sure that the configuration file path is correct.

```bash
pcluster create perflab-yourname -c my-perf-cluster-config.ini
```

Your cluster will take a few minutes to build. The creation status displays in your terminal. Once the cluster is ready, you should see a result similar to the one shown in the following image.

There can be only one cluster of a given name at any time on your account.
