[AWS ParallelCluster](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster) is an AWS-supported, open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. ParallelCluster uses a simple (YAML) text file to model and provision all the resources needed for your HPC applications in an automated and secure manner. We're going to use [parallelcluster ui](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-ui), which we installed in the **Preparation** section, to  create a cluster.

We've broken the steps down to:

1. Create a Cluster with AWS ParallelCluster
2. Connect to the cluster
3. Get to know Slurm
4. Install NCCL and run NCCL Tests
