The [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) allows the creation of REST and WebSocket APIs that act as a front door for applications to access data, business logic or functionality from your additional backend services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

In this section, we will execute the the AWS Lambda function created in the previous section with a REST API created using Amazon API Gateway. The REST API refers to a collection of resources and methods that can be invoked through HTTPS endpoints

1. Open the AWS Management Console and go to **Services** -> **API Gateway**

2. Choose an API type, scroll down to **REST API** and click on Build. In this case we will choose the non-private **REST API**

3. Create new API, click on New API. For API name, say **slurmAPI**. You can leave the Description field blank or provide a short description for your API. Select **Regional** for **Endpoint Type** and then click on **Create API**

4. You will now create the **slurm** resource by choosing the root resource (/) in the Resources tree and selecting **Create Resource** from the Actions dropdown menu as shown

5. Configure the New Child Resource as follows and select **Create Resource**

   **Configure as proxy resource**: unchecked

   **Resource Name**: slurm

   **Resource Path**: /slurm

   **Enable API Gateway CORS**: unchecked

6. In the Resource list, choose **/slurm** and then select **Create Method** from the **Actions** dropdown menu as shown

7. Choose **ANY** from the dropdown menu and click on the checkmark icon as shown. This is basically setting the **ANY** method for HTTP which allows you to use a single API method setup for all the supported HTTP methods

8. In the **/slurm - ANY - Setup** section choose the following settings and click **Save**

   **Integration type**: Lambda Function

   **Use Lambda Proxy integration**: checked

   **Lambda Region**: us-east-1 (or select your appropriate region)

   **Lambda Function**: slurmAPI (Provide the Lambda function name you created in the previous section)

   **Use Default Timeout**: checked

   You will see a message saying, **You are about to give API Gateway permission to invoke your Lambda function**, click **OK**

9. You can now deploy the API by choosing **Deploy API** from the Actions dropdown menu as shown:
   ![API Resource](/images/serverless/api-gateway-8.png)

10. For **Deployment stage** choose **[New Stage]**, for **Stage name** enter **slurm** and then choose **Deploy**

11. Take note of the API's Invoke URL, it is required for the APIs interaction. 

    Example URL

You have successfully created the Slurm API which will execute the Slurm Lamda function. Next, you will interact with your cluster using this Slurm API.
