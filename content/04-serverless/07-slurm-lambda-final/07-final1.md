In the freshly-opened IAM tab, you will see details on the [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) attached to your function. To this role you can attach [IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) which define what this role allows or forbids.

1. Start by accessing the policy editor by clicking on **Attach policies**.
