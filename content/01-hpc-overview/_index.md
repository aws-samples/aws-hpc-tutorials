<!-- Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your [High Performance Computing (HPC) applications](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/). With virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, and HPC system owners can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

AWS delivers an integrated suite of services that provides everything you need to quickly and easily build and manage HPC clusters in the cloud to run the most compute intensive workloads across various industry verticals.

These workloads span the traditional HPC applications, like genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, computer aided engineering, weather prediction, and seismic imaging, as well as emerging applications, like machine learning, deep learning, and autonomous driving.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible configuration and virtually unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services like data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), you can redefine traditional HPC workflows to innovate faster.

Today, more cloud-based HPC applications run on AWS than on any other cloud. -->

Select a workshop from the left panel or just click and explore the workshops highlighted below.

This series of workshops is designed to get you familiar with the concepts and best practices to understand AWS components that help to build an HPC cluster and run your HPC workloads on HPC efficiently.

After an optional introduction and setup, you can walk through the following labs:

- Getting Started in the Cloud helps to familiarize you with the AWS Cloud.

- AWS ParallelCluster introduces you to running HPC workloads in the cloud.

- Amazon FSx for Lustre walks you through HPC focused services.

- AWS Batch teaches to you run a HPC application using the AWS managed service.

- Distributed ML explores how to leverage cloud HPC infrastructure to run data parallel training at scale.

We recommend you take these labs in the order presented as some dependencies exists between them, but feel free to change the order based on your comfort level.
